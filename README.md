## Why do you need this?

Amazon Web Services [API gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) are great tools for building and deploying ["serverless"](http://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-lambda-serverless-cloud/) applications. But using them to deploy more than a couple functions/endpoints involves an excessive amount of manual work such as zipping files, uploading via the web UI, configuring paths and function names, etc. Shep is built to automate as many of these tasks as possible, giving you the ability to deploy an entire API and suite of lambda functions with one CLI command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It will be helpful to have some existing experience with API gateway and Lambda. If you have never used either of these tools before, it is recommended to setup a function manually to see how things are done. Please refer to Amazon's own [getting started guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html)

### AWS credentials

Shep will require your amazon credentials and will load them using the same methods as the AWS CLI tool. This means that you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. Consult [Amazon's CLI documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html) for instructions.

### Installation

`npm install -g shep`

### Creating a new API

Once you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with a user with the correct permissions, you can start using shep.

First you'll want to create a new shep project.
```
shep new my-api
cd my-api
```
Following the prompts will fully configure the project with a region and an [IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role) which will be used to execute your functions.

Next we create an endpoint and the function which it should execute.
```
shep generate endpoint
```
Following the prompts will create the function folder and populate `api.json` with the specified endpoint. You can now edit the function handler.

Next we'll deploy our project.
```
shep deploy
```
Since this is the first deploy, this will create all the Lambda functions on AWS and create the API Gateway project.

The API Gateway and Lambda project is now up and ready to handle calls.


### Using an existing API Gateway project

## Lambda Execution Role

More details to come, but check out the AWS docs about setting up the proper IAM role for lambda: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example-create-iam-role.html

## Why the name 'shep'?

It was called 'shepherd' at first because it was helpful for dealing with *lamb*da but everyone kept shortening it to 'shep' so we changed the name
